Description: Environment for cooperative knowledge management
 sTeam provides a technical platform which allows groups of students, lecturers
 and any other groups to construct and arrange their individual and cooperative
 learning and working space.
 .
 sTeam consists of an object-oriented server connected to a database and Web,
 Java and other (ftp, irc, ...) clients. The server is event-driven and manages
 all user objects as well as the communication between the connected clients. 
 .
 Different from most other cooperation tools is the novel possibility of
 self-organisation and self-administration by the members within the virtual
 environment.
 .
 In the core, the system provides the following self-administrating functions:
 .
     * creation of rooms
     * granting of admission or access authorisations
     * administration and processing of objects or references to objects and
       documents located on other servers
     * carrying objects and passing them on to other users
     * use of rooms as cooperative media (e.g. Shared Whiteboard)
 .

 sTeam needs a mysql server, but it need not necessarily be installed on the
 same computer.
